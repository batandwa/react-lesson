/**
 * Break Component
 *
 * This is a simple functional component that renders a horizontal rule (<hr>).
 * It's used to create a thematic break or separator between content sections.
 *
 * In React, components are the building blocks of the UI. They can be as simple
 * as this one, returning a single HTML element, or they can be complex,
 * managing their own state and lifecycle.
 *
 * Read more about React components:
 * @see {@link https://react.dev/learn/your-first-component}
